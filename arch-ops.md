# Arch-Ops

These days the terms CloudOps (Cloud Operations), DevOps (Development Operations), 

DevSecOps (adding Security), and FinOps (Finance) are all the buzzwords du jour.

.

At the heart of these philosophies and practices are complete automation via

Infrastructure as Code (IAC), Build Factories, and CI/CD/CT Continuous Delivery.

.

In this document we will try to cover everything by splitting this vast domain.







## Agile Architectures


An agile architecture simplifies a complex stack into a cloud-agnostic abstraction.

It is portable, predictable, prescriptive, and make suse of generic re-usable patterns.

This lowers complexity, mitigates risk, and reduces adoption and maintenance time.





#  Complexity

Cloud Managment is all about managing complexity and change on a massive scale.

The way we manage complexity is we break it down in smaller, modular components.


Beyond the technical aspect, deploying to the cloud is a challenge for security.

Complexities like federated multi-clouds or hybrid cloud with on-premise components,

with some exotic services or business data held in remote regions and jurisdictions.



# Nomenclature

We want names that increase human readability, but at the same reduce clutter.

We want to use short monikers or symbols that are unique but remain significant.

Long names should not be used to describe generic or well-known components.

Long names should only be used in the parts that have the most variability.


a purely hyportheical counter-example

    welfare_sandbox_database_resource_group_ns_evt_backend_data_sync

This is bad.  

``welfare`` is a top tenant name and is a much reused term.

``resource_group`` is a genrric and much reused technical term. 

``database`` is a service tier name and is a much reused term.

``ns`` means non-production system, it is superfluous and meaningless.

``evt`` early-visibility-test is meaningless - this is a `dev` environment.


    DSP_WFR_BOMI_MODEL_DEV/_db_rg_backend_data_sync


The bit in UPPERCASE scopes down from tenant to workload and environment.

The bit in lowercase scopes down from resource group and service tier.

Finally the actual lambfa function.



If possible, names are chosen for alphabetical ordering to express logical flows.

Names should sort in natural order for increasing scope.

For example in environments:

    BOX  sandbox       - internal, no backend, internal developer access only           - (replaces sandbox)
    ---
    DEV  development   - internal, mock data, feature development with mock data        - (replaces EVT)
    INT  integration   - internal, partial data, integration with related systems       -
    MNT  maintenance   - internal, limited data, re-production staging and testing      - (replaces UAT) 
    ---
    PRD  production    - external, live backend, live production system                 -
    ---
    TMP  temporary     - external, live sharding, use for overflow or A|B testing       - (we need this)



## Ontology


Key to this is the specification of an ontology, a standard on how we name things.

The best architectures are self-describing and cane be quickly visually grokked.

.

That is we organise our clouds, resources, services, stacks into sets of hierarchies.

These abstract taxonomies are  cloud-agnostic and will map to any cloud providers.

The hierarchies have clear tiers that group things by business or technical domain.

Each taxon tier in our taxonomy is a composite name stringing up short symbols.


```text

Taxnomy:
 
â€‹    aegis _ basis _ clade _ desk _ envt



where:

   aegis  authority (data sovereignty - who regulates the data)
   basis  boundary (data residency - where does the data live)
   clade  custody  (corp custody - who has custody of the data)
   desk   division (data division - for which business domain)
   envt   environment (runtime extent - for what environment scope)

```


  


# Taxonomy

Now for governance, regulatory compliance, and access control we want granularity.

That is we want to be able to scope and subdivide our taxons into taxonomies.




Like Biological taxons, the taxonomy is plastic and we can add sub-taxons.

Sub-taxons use a dot separator, and news taxons can be added, for example,

to define Faccess rights for service facility, feature set, or function.


```text

Sub-Taxons:

    aegis.authority / basis.boundary / clade.custody / desk.division / envt.extent / facility.feature.function

Examples:

  eu.ie   /   gov.extranet  /  gov.public  /  id.mygovid   / prod

# Ontology

# Abstraction

IaC is all about Abstraction, generalising and grouping similar constructs together.

This reduces complexity, increases visibility and makes systems easier to understand.

It enforces homogeneity: reduces differences and give us a common model and interface.

Once we have standardised and modelled things, this in turn allows us to automate them.


# Virtualisation

Abstraction, when pushed to its limits, and applied to Computing, begets Virtualisation.

Given an abstract common model, we can virtualise Machines, Containers, Clusters, Clouds.

This is what drives IaC.


# IAC

Infrastructure-as-Code is really a misnomer - it should be infrastructure as Config.

IaC is supported by a coding language, but it is underpinned by an abstraction Model.

.

The idea is to provide a predictable, prescriptive way to deploy entire systems,

starting with cloud infrastructure, to service cluster, deployment environments,

all the way to binary distributions, dependency libraries, bundled applications

and software configurations - in short everything necessary to get it all running.

# Practice


## Factory

## Access-Control

A secure-vault using a unix password-store is used for storing secrets.

the secrets-vault is backed by SSL certs, SSH keys, and a GPG keyring.

.

## Source Code

All code lives in a git repo. 

Any will do, say github private repos and public repos for open-source.

We recommend github or any other modern git with agile integrations:

a markdown wiki, a bug tracker, pull requests and CI/CD/CT tooling. 



## CI/CD/CT Factory

A CI Factory automated Continuous Integration, Deployment or Delivery, and Testing. 


## Pipelines

The build factory simplified automation through a prescriptive standardised interface.

In an ideal world, everything is generic, prescriptive, standardised, via plugins.

.

Pipelines, in a way are a return to the past, they bring back programmatic scripting.

They complement prescription, filling the gaps where standard plugin confguration

alone cannot fully automate the process. 



# Environments and Spaces

There are different theories on what constitutes a Deployment Environment.

We have chosen a pattern that works for fast agile CI/CD/CT deployments.

.

In our system, an Environment represents a product life-cyle **maturity**.

That is, it represents a well-known stage for a particular feature-set.

This is where the Agile Factory differs from more traditional modes.

.

Whereas some people use Environments for sharded business domains, we do not.

We use **Spaces** to segregate those. Production is still Production no matter

the business domain or Space.  Integration is still Integation notwithstanding.



## Environments

The environment nomenclature has been chosen as it sorts alphabetically.

It has been our experience that human error is a major cause of failures.

This allows a quick visual grok of the maturity of deployed environments.

Crucially always sorting these helps to avoid confusion and reduces risk.

```text

    (BLD) - (local development)

     DEV  - development trunk - ongoing snapshots - in flux

     INT  - integration - feature milestone testing recipes

     MNT  - maintenance - maintenance and staging candidates

     PRD  - production - live production releases (locked)

    (TMP) - ephemeral temporary domain splitting (testing, etc)

```



## Spaces

Spaces or workspaces are functional and/or logical partitions of the business domain.

These are specialisations, that is a DEV environment may have multiple variant spaces.

These Workspaces deploy variant distributions, supra branches of code and configuration.

Spaces typically ship as distributions and use qualifiers.  Here are 2 sample spaces:


    data-api-access-1.0.0-gov-dev-latest

    data-api-access-1.0.0-dsp-dev-latest



 
## Dependencies

We want to Decouple dependencies and have clarity as to their relative maturity.

We use static analysis and a dependency management and enforcement tool chain.

This tool must be able to calculate and selectively forbid transitive dependencies.


    Dependency Enforcement:

    version             allowed transitive dependencies (may depend on)
    ================    =================================================
    foo-prd-release     *-prd-release*
    foo-mnt-staging     *-prd-release*, *-mnt-staging
    foo-int-recipe      *-prd-release*, *-mnt-staging, *-int-recipe
    foo-dev-latest      *-prd-release*, *-mnt-staging, *-int-recipe, *-dev-latest
    foo-bld-snapshot    *-prd-release*, *-mnt-staging, *-int-recipe, *-dev-latest, *-bld-snapshot (anything)



# Databases



## Data Presence

Let us use Presence (Scope) to classify databases in terms of Longevity, Velocity, Volatility.

    - static referential data  (golden-source) very slow, structural data [ex countries, currencies] 

    - stable aggregate data    (historical-data), slow, long-term permanent data [ex census, survey]

    - dynamic solicited data - (session-data)  moderate, query-based data [ex session events, queries]

    - volatile streaming data - (time-series-data) very-fast subscription-based data [ex streams, telemetry]

    - ephemeral cache data - (transient data) locally cached data for performance [ex redis, memcached]


Depending on this Presence, the choice of data pipeline and tech stack will vary.

Presence helps us determine the sort of Database population and migration tooling.

For example:

    - static "Golden-Source" referential data may only need initial population.

    - stable aggregate data may require yearly, semesterly, quartlerly, or monthly updates.

    - Dynamic user-data may require weekly updates or only be populated via a user-session.

    - volatile streaming data may require asynchronous updates, maybe via a Middleware Bus.




# Middleware

The same principles apply to any middleware, Queues or Publish / Subscribe buses.

We use pipelines to manage and evolve ETL transformations and their data sets.



 
# Cloud Infrastructure

Orchestration Cluster

    - azure cloud 
    - aws cloud
    - NET (on-premise) 

Environment Spaces

    - (bld)
    - dev
    - int
    - mnt
    - prd 
    - (tmp)

Service Layers 

    - backend layer: databases, data sources, transformation, caches

    - core layer: micro-services, communications, orchestration, logic 

    - frontend layer: ingress, redirects, clients, presentation

Service Slices

    - stateful data services  (persist session state)

    - stateless services
